# More Context
This ad is being ran as part of a study out of the Georgia Institute of Technology. In a nutshell, the study is focused on identifying bias in FaceBook's advertising algorithms, specifically bias from the demographics of people shown in ad images. 

This study is in particular a *reproducibility study*: a study intended to reproduce (or see if it doesn't reproduce) findings of a previous study. We base our work off of the linked study out of Northeastern.
